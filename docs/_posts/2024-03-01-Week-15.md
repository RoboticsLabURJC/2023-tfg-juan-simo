# Progress This Week

## Objective

TThe objective was to achieve a good general neural pilot yet most tries, even though they started good and took the curve right, suddenly decided to stop turning and went into the wall.

## Data

In order to try and get a better pilot I got more data to train, it is important to state that the number of data is doubled on training because of the data augmentation. In this particular case, as explained last week, the images are fliped on their vertical axis and the angular speed inverted. This way not only we get double the data but we get a perfect balance between rignt and left curves. I have tried training without it and the results have not been netter.

This said, we have 3 different datasets:

### Many curves

This dataset is the main one, taken in a circuit with many curves to both sides, it consists of 3522 pairs of images and velocity comands and has the next data distribution:

### Simple circuit

This dataset has been generated in the circuit we intend to try the models and compare them. It has been used mainly to test the neural net after training, but also to train it in some atepmts. 
It consists of 1338 pairs of images and velocity comands and has the next data distribution:

### Montreal circuit

This dataset has been generated in the Montreal circuit and consists of 1338 pairs of images and velocity comands and has the next data distribution:

### Montmelo circuit

This dataset has been generated in the Montmelo circuit, however it has not been used because the expert pilot was not doing it consistently good and if we take past generals models we should not need more data to make it work.

## Training

I have done loads of attemts changing the learning rate, the number and combination of datasets... However I find a tendency to, no matter what, get down to a loss between 1 and 0.7, and not go down from there ever.

This can be seen in this training curves:

Being the second one better, but not good enough.
