# Progress This Week

## Objective

The objective was to achieve a well-functioning neural pilot, this time with my own datasets. 

## Summary

With all the tests and improvements done this last weeks and more data for the training of the nets I runned a final batch of Neural Pilots.

In order to be able to compare them all of them where trained with the same data (15534 pairs of labels and images) and parameters:
    num_epochs = 100
    batch_size = 128
    learning_rate = 1e-3
    val_split = 0.1
    shuffle_dataset = True
    save_iter = 50
    random_seed = 471
    
The exception being the data processing.

## Expert Pilot

The pilot which generated the datasets can be watch here: https://youtu.be/um7ybjK6Sj0

## Without processing

Result (https://youtu.be/voo4HVciFUY): it goes surpisingly smoothly, but when it gets a bit appart of the line it stops knowing what to do, this proves the dataset doesn't have enough data about this extreeme cases. This surprised me a bit, because one of the datasets, montmelo, was generated in a run I thought was quite bad because the Expert Pilot kept steping out of the line and having to find its way back. However This is why I implemented the afine in my trainings, so lets chek it out.

## Afine

In my previous atempt with someone elses data the afine did not help much and ended up being detrimental. However, after a few adjustments, we got a useflul tool.

Result(https://youtu.be/oLDNV-7qnoc): and with this I finnally achieved a pilot generated compleatly by myself (in this second round of code, I had working ones before) that worked quite well.

## Normalization

</figure>

Result(https://youtu.be/2d9Fo25WvdE): as it could be expected, it accelerated the training, but ended up with a similar behaviour than the neural pilot without processing.

## Afine + normalization

Training graph:

<figure class="align-center" style="width:70%">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Week-19/NORM_AF/Training.png" alt="">

Offline test:

<figure class="align-center" style="width:70%">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Week-19/NORM_AF/Offline_test.png" alt="">
  <figcaption>Offline Test</figcaption>
</figure>

Result(https://youtu.be/4V87uoV7UQI): the traininf was really similar to the afine one, but the result was worse, although better than without it. It may be that compressing the data makes the net make more mistakes and being not that a big range (-1.5 to 1.5) in angular velocity those litle mistakes end up being big ones.

## Conclusion

Given the great results the afine has brought I should keep using it. On the other hand, having a powerfull computer has helped the trainings be donne in more or less half hour, which means accelerating them with normalization is not necesary and has proved detrimental with the results, so I will park it for now unless given other instructions.
